# Chips_Sales_Analysis (Virtual Internship)
 Evaluating how different customer segments and trial stores are performing for a major retailer. This analysis dives into data-driven insights, highlighting customer behavior, product preferences, and how marketing strategies are affecting sales across various store locations

# Executive Summary
Quantium's retail analytics team conducted an in-depth study of customer purchasing behavior in the chips category to guide strategic decisions for the next half-year. The goal was to evaluate how trial store layouts compared to regular store setups, focusing on key metrics like total sales, customer engagement, and shopping patterns. The findings showed that trial stores 77 and 88 saw notable sales growth, driven by an increase in customer visits, while store 86 didnâ€™t perform much differently from its control. The team recommends adopting successful strategies from the trial stores to boost customer traffic across all locations.

# Introduction
Quantium is a leader in using data to provide insights, with expertise in retail analytics. The team was tasked with studying the chips category to give actionable recommendations to the Category Manager. The project involved analyzing transaction and customer data, spotting trends, and comparing the performance of trial store layouts with control stores. Over several weeks, I worked on this project, contributing to data analysis and reporting.

# Data Exploration and Cleaning
The initial step involved reviewing transaction and customer data for any inconsistencies or missing information. I spotted outliers in the total sales data and corrected them using the interquartile range (IQR) method to ensure the data was clean. Then, I merged transaction and customer datasets using loyalty card numbers to create a complete dataset for deeper analysis.

# Data Analysis and Insights
We analyzed key metrics like total sales, sales drivers, and customer segments. Total sales reached $1,921,756.95, with the largest sales driven by mainstream customers and larger chip pack sizes. Visuals such as bar charts helped highlight top-selling products and stores, with 150g and 175g pack sizes being particularly popular. Customer segmentation revealed that older, mainstream customers were key drivers of sales.

# Experimentation and Uplift Testing
To select control stores, we used correlation metrics to find stores with similar sales patterns. The trial stores were compared with these controls, focusing on sales, customer numbers, and transaction data. Stores 77 and 88 performed better than their control counterparts, showing that the trial strategies were successful. The recommendation is to apply the best practices from these stores to other locations to increase sales.

# Conclusion and Recommendations
This analysis provided valuable insights into customer behavior and how effective the trial store layouts were. The results suggest that boosting customer engagement is more important for increasing sales than simply focusing on transaction volume per customer. However, external factors could have influenced sales trends, so further research into seasonal effects and customer preferences is recommended.

# Reflection and Lessons Learned
During this internship, I gained hands-on experience in data analysis, statistical testing, and visualization techniques. I faced challenges such as dealing with data quality issues and interpreting complex data, but these obstacles helped me improve my skills. This experience strengthened my interest in retail analytics.
